"""
Lightweight, additive-only schema migrations for databases created by an
earlier version of the app.

New tables belong directly in schema.sql (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
already handles those safely for both fresh and existing databases). This
module exists only to add a *column* to a table that may already exist from
before that column was introduced - `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` does not
retroactively widen an existing table, so a plain schema.sql change alone
would silently no-op on an upgrade and the app would crash the first time it
tried to read/write the new column.
