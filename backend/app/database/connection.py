"""
Thin wrapper around a single shared aiosqlite connection.

SQLite handles one writer at a time regardless of how many connections you
open, and WAL mode lets readers proceed concurrently with a writer. For an
app with this write volume (one row per check, a handful of checks per
second at most) a single shared connection guarded by an asyncio.Lock for
writes is simpler and just as fast as a connection pool, and avoids
"database is locked" errors that a naive multi-connection setup would hit.
